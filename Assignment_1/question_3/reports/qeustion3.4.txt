Q3.4. Based on your observation from above questions, compare linear interpolation and add-lambda
smoothing by listing out their pros and cons.

-> Linear Interpolation helps us build a stronger or a more robust model, that performs better than
the add-lambda smoothing model. As seen from the perplexities of the two models the Linear
Interpolation model has a significantly low perplexity for both the files. However this model is
very computationally complex; it took me about 11 minutes(669.9 seconds) to build the model and calculate
perplexities for both files, since we need to build our lambdas on the held-out set.

Add lambda smoothing, on the other had, merely took about a minute(87.7 seconds) to build to build
and test the model. However, as mentioned above, it produced significantly high perplexities, even
for the test file that was very similar to the training data.
