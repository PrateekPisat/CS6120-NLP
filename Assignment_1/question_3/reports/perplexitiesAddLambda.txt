Q. Report the perplexity for each file in the test set (for both the λ values).
->
 perplexity(λ=0.1):
  test01.txt = 4877.334553678042
  test02.txt = 2106.2768193293577

  perplexity(λ=0.3):
   test01.txt = 7899.994879400061
   test02.txt = 3991.0809026761635

Q. Based on the test file’s perplexities you got write a brief observation comparing the test files.

-> Since the first test file has a much higher perplexity as compared to the the second file, the
first file consists of a lot of words that are not included in the training files/set. While the
second file has a comparatively lower perplexity, indicating that the contents of it mush be
similar to those of the training files/set
