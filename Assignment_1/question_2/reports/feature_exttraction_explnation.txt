Windows size = +-3
The window would include 3 words before and after the head word. 

Reasons:
1. The window is large enough to include enough context to get the sense of the word and small enough to contain the size of the vocaulary.
2. For N-Gram features, it allows to compute bigrams and trigrams to get context of the word.


New Features:
N-Grams
To disambiguate word sense I build bigrams and trigrams aroung the target word. The inituition is to contruction bigrams and trigrams that
lead up to and trail the target word, since that would provide the most context on the sense of the word. Consider the example explained in class:

-> The guitar and <head>bass</head> player were wating outside the hall.
Target = bass
window = [(The, guitar), (guitar, and), (player, were), (were wating), (The guitar and), (player were wating)]
As we can see, builing n-grams around the target word helps us indentify that here `bass` is used in context of music, and not the fish.
