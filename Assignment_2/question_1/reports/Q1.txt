****Q1 Counts****

sentence counts = 24918

Average Verbs = 5.421261738502287
I am using the POS property of a given word provided by spaCy, and checking if the values is `VERB`

preposition count = 25797

Top Prepositions = ['of', 'for', 'in']

Entity count = 5342

Unique Entity count = 3377

1. Incorrectly tokenizes sentences and hence incorrectly assigns POS tags, which lead to incorrect dependancy arcs.
eg.
The sentence "Right down to the ATM. " is parsed as :
-> Right ADV down ADP to ADP the DET ATM. PROPN SPACE
With a dependancy arc  `Right -> ATM.` labeled `PUNCT`. Since `ATM.` is not the puncuation, there should not exists
an arc.
A possible solution to this would to train the parser on more/relavent data, for with we would be using it on.

2. The problem with incorrect POS tagging causes more problems, for example, In the following sentence:

Hands NOUN down ADP the DET best ADJ damn ADJ BBQ PROPN in ADP Arizona! PROPN

The tokenizer incorrectly tags BBQ as a proper noun, and damn as a Adjective.
Due to which the dependancy edge between "BBQ" and "damn" is incorrectly labeled as a adjective modifier where it should have been a compound noun.
