# Assignments 1

**This assignment was built using Python 3.7.2 and on Ubuntu, which would be the recomended environment to run the code.**

## Late Days

I'll be using *ONE* late day for this assignment.

## Setup

The required dependancies are included in the `deps` file. to install use `pip install -r deps`

## Structure

Each question as assigned a folder. `/question_1` consists of just one file. Every other folder consists of a `/train`, `/reports` and in some cases< br >
a `/test` folder. These contain the training, generated reports and the test data respectively. Each folder has one file which contain a `main` function. < br >
This is the driver program. List of driver programs for each folder:

1. Question_2: `features.py`
2. question_3: `perplexity.py`
3. question_4: `counts.py`

The reports/text answers should be available in the `question_*/reports` folder.

## Execution
To run each of the driver files use:

```bash
python filename.py
```

**Note:** It is imperative that you use Python 3 to run these files, and will result in syntax should you run them using Python2.

## Install Deps

```bash
pip install -r deps
```
